users = {"mary": 22, "caroline": 99, "harry": 24}

print(users["mary"])  # OUTPUT: 22

# You can access any of the other integer values with their respective keys.

# You can use a similar syntax as for a dictionary lookup also to change a value in the dictionary:
users['harry'] = 20
print(users['harry'])  # OUTPUT: 20
