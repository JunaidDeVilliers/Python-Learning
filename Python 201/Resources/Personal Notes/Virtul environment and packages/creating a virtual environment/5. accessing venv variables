To use one of your virtual environment variables inside of your Python project, you need to access it. 
You can do that for example with Python's os module that comes packaged with the standard library:

import os

secret = os.environ['MY_SUPER_SECRET_SECRET']
print(secret)

You'll be able to run this code from any file in your project, as long as your virtual environment is 
activated, and an environment variable called MY_SUPER_SECRET_SECRET is defined.

If you don't want your script to terminate with an exception when you didn't define the environment 
variable, then you can use Python's dict.get() method instead of doing a direct lookup.


Note: Make sure that you add your virtual environment folder to your .gitignore file, or you'll end 
up pushing your secrets to GitHub after all.
