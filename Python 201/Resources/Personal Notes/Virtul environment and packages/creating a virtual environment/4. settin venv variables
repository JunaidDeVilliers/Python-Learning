When you do any project-specific development, you always want to avoid setting anything for your 
whole system. This holds for your third-party Python packages. The same counts for secrets, which are 
usually project-specific.

It's a much better idea to set these types of environment variables inside of your virtual environment. 
In this course, these types of variables will be called virtual environment variables.

Using environment variables inside of a Python virtual environment is easier than having to first 
export and then unset each variable every time that you want to work on a project.

Start by creating a virtual environment for your Python project:

*   python3 -m venv venv

After you successfully created a virtual environment, open the activate script in your favorite text 
editor.

This Bash script runs every time your venv gets activated, which makes it a good place to let your 
computer know which environment variables you would like to have access to, and which ones to get rid 
of once you exit the virtual environment.

You'll now edit the activate script and hard-code the values you want in there. First, you need to 
make sure that your virtual environment variables won’t stick around once you deactivated them, so 
you start by unsetting the environment variable that you haven't even created yet.

To unset a virtual environment variable, you add an unset command to the deactivate command section in 
your Bash activate script. The code in this part of the script runs every time you deactivate your 
virtual environment.

For example, to unset the variable MY_SUPER_SECRET_SECRET, you need to add the following line of Bash 
code:

deactivate () {
    unset MY_SUPER_SECRET_SECRET
    # Lots of other code
}

Adding this line in the deactivate section makes sure that your virtual environment variables won't 
leak into your system environment. Instead, they'll exist only within your virtual environment.

Once you wrote the code to unset your variable, it's time to make sure you also set it, so it'll 
exist in the first place.
