Explore the interpreter:

- Execute lines with syntax error and see what the response is.
  - What happens if you leave out a quotation or parenthesis?
      Prints 3 dots and does nothing beyond that
  - How helpful are the error messages?
      unclear

- Use the `help()` function to explore what you can do with the interpreter.
  - For example execute `help('print')`.
  - Press `q` to exit.
